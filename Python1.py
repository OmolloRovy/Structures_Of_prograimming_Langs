def calculate_sum(a, b):
    # This is a function definition with two parameters: a and b
    result = a + b
    # This is an assignment statement that calculates the sum of a and b
    return result
    # This is a return statement that returns the result

num1 = 5

# These are variable assignments with values 5 and 10 

total = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
# This is a function call to calculate_sum with arguments num1 and num2
# The result of the function call is assigned to the variable total
