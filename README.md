JavaScript Structure Analysis



the  lexical, syntactic, contextual, and semantic structures:

javascript
// Lexical Structure
var x = 5; // Variable declaration and assignment
function multiply(a, b) { // Function declaration
  return a * b; // Return statement
}

// Syntactic Structure
if (x > 0) { // If statement
  console.log("Positive number"); // Console output
} else {
  console.log("Negative number");
}

// Contextual Structure
var result = multiply(x, 2); 
// Calling the multiply function with arguments
console.log("Result:", result); // Console output

// Semantic Structure
// The program checks if the variable 'x' is positive or negative,
// multiplies it by 2 using the 'multiply' function, and logs the result.
In this program:

Lexical Structure: It includes variable declaration (var x = 5;), function declaration (function multiply(a, b) { ... }), and keywords (if, else, return, console.log).

Syntactic Structure: It comprises the organization of statements and expressions, such as the if statement and the block of code within curly braces.

Contextual Structure: It represents the context in which the code is executed, including variable scope and function calls. In this example, the multiply function is defined in the global scope, and the multiply function is called with the variable x as an argument.

Semantic Structure: It involves the meaning and interpretation of the code. The program checks if x is positive or negative, multiplies it by 2 using the multiply function, and logs the result to the console.
